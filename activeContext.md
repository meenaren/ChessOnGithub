# Active Context: ChessOnGithub (2025-05-11 Task Update: P2P Resilience)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current task focused on enhancing P2P communication resilience by implementing error handling for disconnections and a game state resynchronization mechanism. This task is now considered complete at a foundational level.

## 2. Recent Changes & Completed Features (P2P Resilience Task)

- **Type Definitions (`src/utils/types.ts`):**
    - Added `REQUEST_GAME_STATE`, `SYNC_GAME_STATE` to `P2PMessageKeyEnum`.
    - Defined `RequestGameStatePayload` (as `null`), `SyncGameStatePayload` (fen, turn, gameStatus, lastMove, moveHistory, player IDs, hostInitiated flag).
    - Defined `RequestGameStateMessage`, `SyncGameStateMessage` types.
    - Updated `AnyP2PMessage` union to include new message types.
    - Added new `GameStatus` enum values: `CONNECTION_LOST_ATTEMPTING_RECONNECT`, `OPPONENT_RECONNECTED_AWAITING_SYNC`, `RESYNCHRONIZING_GAME_STATE`, `RESYNCHRONIZATION_SUCCESSFUL`, `RESYNCHRONIZATION_FAILED`.
    - Added `moveHistory: Move[]` to `AppGameState` interface.

- **P2P Service Utilities (`src/modules/p2pService.ts`):**
    - Added `createRequestGameStateMessage()` function.
    - Added `createSyncGameStateMessage()` function.

- **Game Connection Hook (`src/hooks/useGameConnection.ts`):**
    - Improved `onPeerLeave` handler to set `connectionStatus` to `GameStatus.CONNECTION_LOST_ATTEMPTING_RECONNECT` and `GameStatus.DISCONNECTED_OPPONENT_LEFT`.
    - Updated `onPeerJoin` handler to set `connectionStatus` to `GameStatus.OPPONENT_RECONNECTED_AWAITING_SYNC` if a known opponent rejoins, signaling `App.tsx` to manage sync.
    - Ensured `connectionStatus` state uses new `GameStatus` enum values.
    - Corrected a scope issue with `playerColorForOpponent` variable.

- **Main Application (`src/App.tsx`):**
    - Added `moveHistory: AppMove[]` to `AppGameState` state, initialized as empty and updated on each successful local or opponent move.
    - Extended `useEffect` for `receivedData` to handle:
        - `REQUEST_GAME_STATE`: Host sends `SYNC_GAME_STATE` message with current FEN, turn, status, move history, and player IDs.
        - `SYNC_GAME_STATE`: Client updates its local game state (FEN, turn, status, move history) from the payload. Sets `gameState.status` to reflect resynchronization progress.
    - Updated `useEffect` for `connectionStatus` (from `useGameConnection`) to:
        - Trigger host to send `SYNC_GAME_STATE` if `connectionStatus` is `GameStatus.OPPONENT_RECONNECTED_AWAITING_SYNC`.
        - Update `gameState.status` based on `GameStatus.CONNECTION_LOST_ATTEMPTING_RECONNECT` and `GameStatus.DISCONNECTED_OPPONENT_LEFT`.
    - Ensured `moveHistory` is correctly added to `AppGameState` and updated.

- **Status Display Component (`src/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`):**
    - Updated to display user-friendly messages for new `GameStatus` enum values related to disconnection and resynchronization (`CONNECTION_LOST_ATTEMPTING_RECONNECT`, `OPPONENT_RECONNECTED_AWAITING_SYNC`, `RESYNCHRONIZING_GAME_STATE`, `RESYNCHRONIZATION_SUCCESSFUL`, `RESYNCHRONIZATION_FAILED`).

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Thorough Testing - P2P Resilience:**
    *   Test disconnection scenarios (host leaves, client leaves).
    *   Test reconnection scenarios and verify game state resynchronization.
    *   Verify UI updates correctly reflect connection and resync statuses.
    *   Test what happens if resynchronization fails or if states conflict (currently, host is source of truth).
2.  **Testing - Core P2P Gameplay (as previously planned):**
    *   Test hosting a game and having another player join.
    *   Verify correct color assignment and board orientation.
    *   Play through several games, testing all move types (castling, en passant, promotion).
    *   Verify check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions are correctly detected and displayed.
    *   Test resignation.
3.  **Bug Fixing:** Address any issues found during testing.
4.  **Refinement - UI/UX:**
    *   Improve visual feedback for invalid moves.
    *   Implement UI for pawn promotion selection (currently defaults to Queen or relies on `chess.js` default).
    *   Enhance display of game end states.
5.  **Advanced P2P Features (Future Scope):**
    *   Implement draw offers/acceptance.
    *   Chat functionality.
    *   More robust automatic reconnection attempts (client-side).
    *   Handling resynchronization conflicts more gracefully if non-host state is more recent.
6.  **Code Cleanup & Documentation:**
    *   Review code for clarity and add comments where necessary.
    *   Ensure all Memory Bank files are up-to-date with final decisions.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Source of Truth for Resync:** Currently, the host is the primary source of truth for game state resynchronization. If the connection drops mid-game, the player whose turn it *was* could also be a candidate, but host-priority was simpler for this initial implementation. This might need refinement if conflicts arise where the client had a more up-to-date state before disconnection.
- **Automatic Reconnection:** The client-side automatic reconnection in `useGameConnection.ts` is currently very basic (sets status, doesn't aggressively retry joining). More robust retry logic with backoff could be added.
- **Move History for Full Resync:** The `moveHistory` is now part of `SYNC_GAME_STATE`. This allows for more robust validation on the receiving end if needed in the future (e.g., replaying moves to verify FEN).
- **Error Handling for Resync Failure:** If `SYNC_GAME_STATE` fails or data is corrupt, the current implementation sets a "failed" status. More user-friendly recovery options (e.g., offer new game) could be added.

## 5. Important Patterns and Preferences

- Continue using `react-chessboard` and `chess.js`.
- Maintain separation of concerns: UI, game logic, P2P communication.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- Host-centric model for initial game setup and resynchronization simplifies initial logic.

## 6. Learnings and Project Insights

- Implementing resynchronization adds significant complexity to state management in `App.tsx` and interaction with `useGameConnection.ts`.
- Clear P2P message types and defined `GameStatus` states are crucial for managing these complex interactions.
- Testing various disconnection and reconnection scenarios will be critical to ensure robustness.
- The `moveHistory` array, while simple, provides a good foundation for more advanced state validation if needed.
