# Active Context: ChessOnGithub (2025-05-11 Update)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The previous primary focus on implementing core chess gameplay functionality is now **complete**.
Current focus shifts to:
- Thorough testing of the implemented gameplay.
- Bug fixing and refinement based on testing.
- Potentially addressing minor UI/UX improvements related to gameplay feedback.

## 2. Recent Changes & Completed Features (Core Gameplay Task)

- **Memory Bank Established:** Initial versions of all core memory bank files created (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- **Type Definitions (`src/utils/types.ts`):**
    - Defined comprehensive types for P2P messages (`P2PMessage`, `P2PMessageKeyEnum`, specific payload types like `ConnectionConfirmedPayload`, `MovePayload`, `InitialGameSetupPayload`, `GameStateUpdatePayload`, `ErrorPayload`, and `AnyP2PMessage` union).
    - Defined types for game entities (`PlayerColor`, `PieceSymbol`, `GameStatus` enum, `Square`, `Move`, `CastlingRights`).
    - Defined `AppGameState` for the main application state.
    - Resolved numerous TypeScript errors to ensure type safety and compatibility with Trystero.
- **Game Logic Module (`src/modules/gameLogic.ts`):**
    - Implemented `initializeNewGame()` to get starting FEN.
    - Implemented `makeMove()` using `chess.js` to validate and apply moves, returning new FEN.
    - Implemented `getGameStatus()` to determine check, checkmate, stalemate, draw conditions, and current turn, returning a `GameLogicState` object including an `AppGameStatus`.
- **Chessboard Component (`src/components/Board.tsx`):**
    - Integrated `react-chessboard`.
    - Handles `onPieceDrop` callback to attempt local moves.
    - Configured `boardOrientation` based on player color.
    - Manages `arePiecesDraggable` based on current turn and connection status.
- **Status Display Component (`src/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`):**
    - Displays current player's turn.
    - Shows various game status messages based on `GameStatus` enum (check, checkmate, draw types, connection states).
    - Displays player color and connection information.
- **P2P Service Utilities (`src/modules/p2pService.ts`):**
    - Updated message creation functions (`createMoveMessage`, `createGameStateMessage`, `createResignMessage`, etc.) to use new types and `P2PMessageKeyEnum`.
    - Ensured correct payload structure (e.g., `payload: null` for simple messages).
- **Game Connection Hook (`src/hooks/useGameConnection.ts`):**
    - Updated to use `AnyP2PMessage` for generic message handling.
    - Corrected payload creation for `CONNECTION_CONFIRMED` message to include all required (nullable) fields.
    - Ensured correct import and usage of `P2PMessageKeyEnum` and specific message types.
- **Connection Manager Component (`src/components/ConnectionManager.tsx`):**
    - Refactored to be a presentational component, receiving P2P state and control functions as props from `App.tsx`.
    - Defined `ConnectionManagerProps` to accept necessary data and callbacks.
- **Main Application (`src/App.tsx`):**
    - Integrated `ConnectionManager`, `Board`, and `StatusDisplay`.
    - Manages overall `AppGameState`.
    - Uses `useGameConnection` hook to handle P2P interactions.
    - Implements `handleHostGame` and `handleJoinGame` logic.
    - Host assigns 'w' (White) to self and 'b' (Black) to joiner.
    - Host sends `INITIAL_GAME_SETUP` message with starting FEN to joiner.
    - Handles `MOVE` messages from opponent, validates with `gameLogic.ts`, and updates state.
    - Local moves are validated, applied, and sent to opponent.
    - Enforces turn-based play.
    - Handles `RESIGN` messages.
    - Basic game synchronization logic implemented.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Testing - P2P Gameplay:**
    *   Test hosting a game and having another player join.
    *   Verify correct color assignment and board orientation.
    *   Play through several games, testing all move types (castling, en passant - if fully supported by `chess.js` move object, promotion - basic for now).
    *   Verify check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw conditions are correctly detected and displayed.
    *   Test resignation.
    *   Test disconnections and reconnections (if supported by Trystero/hook).
2.  **Bug Fixing:** Address any issues found during testing.
3.  **Refinement - UI/UX:**
    *   Improve visual feedback for invalid moves.
    *   Consider UI for pawn promotion selection.
    *   Enhance display of game end states.
4.  **Advanced P2P Features (Future Scope):**
    *   Implement draw offers/acceptance.
    *   Chat functionality.
    *   More robust error handling and resynchronization logic.
5.  **Code Cleanup & Documentation:**
    *   Review code for clarity and add comments where necessary.
    *   Ensure all Memory Bank files are up-to-date with final decisions.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Pawn Promotion UI:** Currently, `gameLogic.makeMove` and `App.handlePieceDrop` assume basic promotion or that `chess.js` handles it by default (e.g., to Queen). A UI for selecting promotion piece is needed for full functionality.
- **Error Handling for P2P:** While basic connection status is shown, more robust error handling for message failures or desyncs might be needed.
- **State Management for Complex Features:** If features like game history, spectating, or more complex UI interactions are added, a more advanced state management solution (Context API with reducers, Zustand, etc.) might be beneficial over prop drilling.

## 5. Important Patterns and Preferences

- Continue using `react-chessboard` and `chess.js`.
- Maintain separation of concerns: UI, game logic, P2P communication.
- TypeScript for type safety.

## 6. Learnings and Project Insights

- Core gameplay loop is functional.
- P2P message passing for moves and game setup is working.
- Type safety significantly helped in integrating different modules, though it required many iterations to get right with the P2P library's expectations.
- The current state management in `App.tsx` is manageable but could become complex with more features.
