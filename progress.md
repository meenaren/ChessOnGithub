# Progress: ChessOnGithub (2025-05-11 Update)

## 1. What Works

- **Memory Bank Setup:**
    - [`projectbrief.md`](projectbrief.md) created and populated.
    - [`productContext.md`](productContext.md) created and populated.
    - [`systemPatterns.md`](systemPatterns.md) created and populated.
    - [`techContext.md`](techContext.md) created and populated.
    - [`activeContext.md`](activeContext.md) created and populated (and updated post-task).
- **Core Gameplay Functionality:**
    - **Type Definitions (`src/utils/types.ts`):** Comprehensive and type-safe definitions for P2P messages, game entities, and application state.
    - **Game Logic (`src/modules/gameLogic.ts`):**
        - Game initialization (`initializeNewGame`).
        - Move validation and execution (`makeMove`) using `chess.js`.
        - Game status determination (`getGameStatus`) covering check, checkmate, stalemate, and various draw conditions.
    - **Chessboard UI (`src/components/Board.tsx`):**
        - `react-chessboard` integration for visual board display.
        - Handles player move input via piece drop.
        - Board orientation based on player color.
        - Conditional piece draggability.
    - **Status Display (`src/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`):**
        - Shows current turn and detailed game status messages.
        - Displays player color and connection info.
    - **P2P Communication & Integration:**
        - **Message Utilities (`src/modules/p2pService.ts`):** Helper functions for creating typed P2P messages.
        - **Connection Hook (`src/hooks/useGameConnection.ts`):** Manages P2P connection via Trystero, handles sending/receiving generic game messages, assigns colors (host as White).
        - **Connection UI (`src/components/ConnectionManager.tsx`):** Refactored to be a presentational component for hosting/joining games, taking state and handlers from `App.tsx`.
    - **Main Application Logic (`src/App.tsx`):**
        - Orchestrates game flow and manages `AppGameState`.
        - Integrates all UI components and logic modules.
        - Handles P2P message events (initial setup, moves, resignation).
        - Synchronizes game state between players.
        - Enforces turn-based play.
        - Basic resignation feature implemented.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Next Focus Areas)

- **Thorough P2P Gameplay Testing:**
    - Connection stability and recovery (if applicable).
    - All move types (castling, en passant, promotion - UI for promotion needed).
    - Edge cases in game logic and state synchronization.
    - Resignation and game end condition handling across clients.
- **Bug Fixing:** Address issues identified during testing.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**
    - Pawn promotion selection UI.
    - Clearer visual feedback for invalid moves, checks, and game end states.
    - Potentially highlight last move made.
- **Advanced P2P Features (Future Scope):**
    - Draw offers and acceptance.
    - Chat functionality.
    - More robust error handling and game state resynchronization mechanisms.
- **Code Quality & Documentation:**
    - Further code comments and cleanup.
    - Update Memory Bank with any new patterns or significant decisions arising from testing/refinement.

## 3. Current Status

- **Core Gameplay Implemented:** The primary features for a two-player P2P chess game are in place.
- **Ready for Testing and Refinement:** The application needs comprehensive testing to ensure stability and correctness.

## 4. Known Issues / Considerations

- **Pawn Promotion UI:** Not yet implemented; promotion defaults to Queen or relies on `chess.js` default if not specified.
- **Advanced Draw Conditions:** While `gameLogic.ts` detects them, P2P messaging for agreeing to draws (e.g., draw offer/accept) is not yet implemented.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Current error handling for P2P issues or unexpected game states is basic.
- **State Management Scalability:** `App.tsx` manages significant state. For future complex features, a more dedicated state management solution might be needed.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Decision:** Establish Memory Bank files first. (Completed)
- **Core Gameplay Implementation:** Focused on building out `types.ts`, `gameLogic.ts`, UI components (`Board`, `StatusDisplay`, `ConnectionManager`), and integrating them in `App.tsx` with P2P communication via `useGameConnection.ts` and `p2pService.ts`. (Completed)
    - Extensive iteration was required to correctly define TypeScript types for P2P payloads to be compatible with Trystero and ensure type safety across modules.
- **Next Decision:** Prioritize thorough testing of the implemented core gameplay, followed by bug fixing and initial UI/UX refinements (especially pawn promotion).
