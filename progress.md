# Progress: ChessOnGithub (2025-05-11 Update: P2P Resilience Implemented)

## 1. What Works

- **Memory Bank Setup:**
    - All core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are established and regularly updated.
- **Core Gameplay Functionality:**
    - **Type Definitions (`src/utils/types.ts`):** Comprehensive and type-safe definitions for P2P messages, game entities, and application state.
    - **Game Logic (`src/modules/gameLogic.ts`):** Game initialization, move validation/execution, and game status determination are functional.
    - **Chessboard UI (`src/components/Board.tsx`):** Integrated and handles player moves, orientation, and conditional draggability.
    - **Status Display (`src/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`):** Shows current turn, game status, player info.
    - **P2P Communication & Integration (`src/modules/p2pService.ts`, `src/hooks/useGameConnection.ts`, `src/components/ConnectionManager.tsx`):**
        - Connection establishment (hosting and joining).
        - Typed P2P message creation and handling for game setup, moves, and resignation.
    - **Main Application Logic (`src/App.tsx`):** Orchestrates game flow, manages `AppGameState`, integrates components, synchronizes basic game state, and enforces turn-based play.
- **P2P Resilience (NEW):**
    - **Disconnection Detection (`src/hooks/useGameConnection.ts`):**
        - `onPeerLeave` now updates `connectionStatus` to reflect disconnections (e.g., `GameStatus.CONNECTION_LOST_ATTEMPTING_RECONNECT`, `GameStatus.DISCONNECTED_OPPONENT_LEFT`).
    - **Reconnection Status Updates (`src/hooks/useGameConnection.ts`):**
        - `onPeerJoin` updates `connectionStatus` to `GameStatus.OPPONENT_RECONNECTED_AWAITING_SYNC` if a known opponent rejoins.
    - **Game State Resynchronization Types & Messages (`src/utils/types.ts`, `src/modules/p2pService.ts`):**
        - New P2P message types (`REQUEST_GAME_STATE`, `SYNC_GAME_STATE`) and payloads defined.
        - Helper functions `createRequestGameStateMessage` and `createSyncGameStateMessage` implemented.
        - `AppGameState` now includes `moveHistory`.
        - New `GameStatus` enums for resynchronization flow.
    - **Resynchronization Logic (`src/App.tsx`):**
        - Host responds to `REQUEST_GAME_STATE` by sending `SYNC_GAME_STATE` (including FEN, turn, status, move history).
        - Client processes `SYNC_GAME_STATE` to update its local game state.
        - Host automatically sends `SYNC_GAME_STATE` if opponent reconnects (`GameStatus.OPPONENT_RECONNECTED_AWAITING_SYNC`).
    - **UI Feedback for Resilience (`src/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`):**
        - Displays new statuses related to disconnections and resynchronization attempts/outcomes.

## 2. What's Left to Build (Next Focus Areas)

- **Thorough P2P Resilience Testing:**
    - Test various disconnection scenarios (host leaves, client leaves, temporary network drops).
    - Verify game state resynchronization works correctly in different situations.
    - Confirm UI accurately reflects all connection and resync statuses.
    - Test edge cases: resync failure, conflicting states (currently host-priority).
- **Core P2P Gameplay Testing (Continued):**
    - All move types (castling, en passant, promotion - UI for promotion still needed).
    - Edge cases in game logic.
    - Resignation and game end condition handling across clients.
- **Bug Fixing:** Address issues identified during all testing phases.
- **UI/UX Refinements:**
    - Pawn promotion selection UI remains a priority.
    - Clearer visual feedback for invalid moves, checks, and game end states.
    - Potentially highlight last move made.
- **Advanced P2P Features (Future Scope):**
    - Draw offers and acceptance.
    - Chat functionality.
    - More robust automatic reconnection attempts (client-side with backoff).
    - More sophisticated handling of resynchronization conflicts.
- **Code Quality & Documentation:**
    - Further code comments and cleanup.
    - Update Memory Bank with any new patterns or significant decisions arising from testing/refinement.

## 3. Current Status

- **Core Gameplay Implemented and Enhanced:** The game is playable P2P with foundational resilience to disconnections and a mechanism for game state resynchronization.
- **Ready for Comprehensive Testing:** The application, especially the new resilience features, needs thorough testing.

## 4. Known Issues / Considerations

- **Pawn Promotion UI:** Not yet implemented.
- **Advanced Draw Conditions:** P2P messaging for agreed draws not implemented.
- **Resynchronization Robustness:**
    - Current resync is host-prioritized. Conflicts where client state might be more valid are not handled.
    - Client-side automatic reconnection is basic.
    - Error handling for failed resync is limited to status updates.
- **State Management Scalability:** `App.tsx` manages significant state; complexity is increasing.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Decision:** Establish Memory Bank files first. (Completed)
- **Core Gameplay Implementation:** Focused on `types.ts`, `gameLogic.ts`, UI components, and `App.tsx` integration with P2P. (Completed)
- **P2P Resilience Implementation (Current Task):** Added disconnection detection, status updates, and a host-initiated game state resynchronization mechanism. This involved changes across types, P2P services, connection hooks, main app logic, and status display. (Completed at foundational level)
- **Next Decision:** Prioritize thorough testing of the new P2P resilience features alongside continued testing of core gameplay. Address pawn promotion UI next.
