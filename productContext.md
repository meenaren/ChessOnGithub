# Product Context: ChessOnGithub

## 1. Why This Project Exists

This project aims to provide a simple and accessible way for two individuals to play chess online without requiring complex setups or dedicated chess platforms. The P2P nature allows for direct connection and gameplay.

## 2. Problems It Solves

- **Accessibility:** Enables chess gameplay directly, potentially within a familiar environment like GitHub or a simple web app.
- **Simplicity:** Avoids the need for user accounts on third-party chess servers for a quick game.
- **Direct Connection:** Facilitates a direct P2P game experience.

## 3. How It Should Work

- Two users connect to each other via a P2P mechanism.
- One player is assigned White, the other Black.
- The game starts with the standard chess setup.
- Players take turns making moves on a visual chessboard.
- The application validates moves according to standard chess rules.
- The game state is synchronized between both players after each move.
- The application indicates whose turn it is and displays game status (e.g., check, checkmate, stalemate).
- The game concludes when a checkmate, stalemate, or other draw condition is reached.

## 4. User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive Gameplay:** Making moves should be straightforward and natural.
- **Clear Feedback:** Users should always understand the current game state, whose turn it is, and any special conditions (like check).
- **Responsive Interface:** The UI should update promptly to reflect moves and game status changes.
- **Reliable Connection:** The P2P connection should be stable enough for uninterrupted gameplay.
- **Easy Setup:** Initiating a game with another player should be as simple as possible.
