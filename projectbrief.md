# Project Brief: ChessOnGithub

## 1. Core Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a functional peer-to-peer (P2P) chess application that can be played directly on GitHub (or as a web application).

Core requirements include:
- Implementing standard chess rules and gameplay.
- Establishing P2P connections between two players.
- Synchronizing game state between players in real-time.
- Displaying the chessboard and game status.
- Allowing players to make moves.
- Detecting game end conditions (checkmate, stalemate).

## 2. Project Scope

The initial scope focuses on:
- Core chess logic (move validation, game state management).
- A visual chessboard interface.
- P2P communication for move synchronization.
- Basic UI for game status and player turns.

Future enhancements could include:
- User authentication.
- Game history and replay.
- Different game modes (e.g., timed games).
- More advanced UI/UX features.

## 3. Technology Stack (Initial)

- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Chess Engine: `chess.js`
- Chessboard UI: `react-chessboard`
- P2P Communication: (Leveraging existing `p2pService.ts` and `useGameConnection.ts`)
