# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1. Introduction

This document outlines the specifications for a simple Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Chess application. The primary goal is to enable two players on different devices to play a game of chess directly with each other using a web browser.

## 1.2. Project Goals

*   Develop a functional client-side chess application.
*   Implement P2P communication for real-time gameplay between two players.
*   Ensure basic chess rule enforcement.
*   Provide a simple and intuitive user interface.
*   The application must be hostable on GitHub Pages.

## 1.3. Target Users

*   Two individuals wishing to play chess against each other remotely without needing a central server for gameplay.

## 1.4. Key Features (High-Level)

*   **P2P Connection:** Players can connect to each other, one acting as a host and the other as a joiner, typically by sharing a unique game identifier.
*   **Chess Gameplay:** Standard chess moves, piece captures, and board state updates.
*   **Rule Enforcement:** Basic validation of legal moves, check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions.
*   **Turn Indication:** Clear visual cue for whose turn it is.
*   **Game End Notification:** Clear indication of game end states (checkmate, stalemate, resignation - if implemented).
*   **Simple UI:** A visual representation of the chessboard, pieces, and game status.

## 1.5. Core Technologies Constraint

*   **Client-Side:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (implies no server-side backend for game logic or persistent storage beyond what P2P libraries might use for signaling temporarily).
*   **P2P Communication:** A JavaScript P2P library (e.g., PeerJS, or direct WebRTC implementation) will be necessary for data exchange between the two players.
